# pinim

I'm goofing around with using [ziglang](https://ziglang.org/) as a build tool for a C codebase. Right now it's just me experimenting, but it'll be a small game (eventually).

Prerequisites:  
zig 0.14.0 (or higher)  

Instructions:  
```
git clone https://github.com/jessechounard/pinim.git
cd pinim
zig build run
```
